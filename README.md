# Project2
## Meredith Gray & Morgan Blanchard
# Overview
Our first dataset is Spotify top songs from 2017-2021 and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/spotify-charts

Our second dataset contains the musical data as well as links to the songs from soundcloud and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/josshhh/spotify-songs-with-soundcloud-links

In order to run our code, you will need to download both of these datasets. The first dataset should be saved in the Data folder and named 'charts'csv'. The second dataset should also be saved in the Data folder and named 'Soundcloud_data.csv'. The Soundcloud file will need to be saved as a csv instead of an excel file.
